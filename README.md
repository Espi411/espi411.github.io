About Us

Katharine Weinwurm, DD has been serving clients in all of southwest Ontario since 2003. Consultations are free and a referral from a dentist is not required.

This denture clinic is located in a private setting where care is made to prevent appointments from overlapping. For this reason, clients are seen by appointment only. Before visiting the office, please call or text: (905) 804-8428.

New clients are always welcome!
